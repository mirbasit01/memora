                  regular Airdrop Farming Savages, it’s good to see you again.
                  Today, we’re here to discuss an elaborate airdrop farming
                  guide & strategy, including tips.

                <p>
                  We’re part of the airdrop class of ’17 and the BitcoinTalk
                  Forums. So in 2018, we shared our knowledge and taught the
                  newcomers how to earn crypto, which eventually got over 350k
                  reads. And in 2021 when DeFi came to the scene, we showed over
                  200k users how to earn there.

                  Every landscape in crypto is rapidly changing, so we’re back
                  with a full guide on airdrop farming for 2024 and 2025.

                <p>
                  Airdrop season has started and everybody loves free crypto. If
                  you dedicate time and effort towards farming, you can have a
                  6-figure year. No matter what capital you start with. If you
                  are new to the wonderful world of airdrops, I suggest you have
                  a glance at the biggest airdrops of 2023, to get the blood
                  flowing and get you hyped up to study this blog.

                  Warning: Understand The Risks of Airdrop Farming
                </h2>

                <p>
                  Every layer in crypto comes with risks. Airdrop farming is no
                  different.
                </p>

                <p className="mt-3">
                  First off, you have your own responsibility for security.
                  Never share your private keys, don’t click random links, have
                  funds on hardware wallets, don’t get hacked, and all that
                  stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But on top of that, you’re exposing yourself to new protocols
                  and projects. Which comes with a risk in itself. Outside of
                  CEX exchanges, often the biggest hacks in crypto are either
                  bridges or layer-2 solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Take that into consideration when you start airdrop farming.
                  Reduce risks by spreading funds and working on your online
                  security. You want to protect the free cryptocurrency you’re
                  earning.

                  <h2>1] The Easy Airdrops + Bonus Hunting</h2>
                  <p>
                    This first chapter is focused on beginners and our farmers
                    who are low on capital. If you are more experienced, or have
                    a decent wallet size to play with head over to the next
                    chapter on wallets or even jump to the trading airdrops.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you’re a brand new airdrop farmer, or if you are low on
                    liquid. I suggest you start farming easy airdrops that don’t
                    require funds. What they usually do require are some social
                    media tasks to create some exposure and project awareness.
                    You know the basic, follow & retweet kind of stuff. Or join
                    a newsletter or Discord group. Often, these projects are in
                    fundraising mode, product release, or just plain meme coins.
                    Sometimes they are looking for users, so they want you to
                    create an account or download a dApp.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Whatever they are, try to collect and start building your
                    bankroll
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, we’re not here to lie to your face and say you can
                    become financially free by getting these easy airdrops.
                    That’s just not the case. But it’s low-hanging fruit,
                    collect some free $ here and there with some easy tasks.
                    Keep stacking those small wins until you have some capital
                    to farm the next few chapters of this blog
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can farm these types of airdrops on multiple wallets and
                    by creating several social media accounts you can join them
                    multiple times. Find all the new airdrops listed on Airdrop
                    Alert.
                  </p>
                  Two Airdrops I’m farming that don’t require capital are Grass
                  and Gemz
                </div>
                <div className="Claim">
                  <h2>Claim Your Bonus</h2>
                  <p>
                    Another tactic is to hunt for bonus rewards on Exchanges,
                    Crypto Casinos (Rollbit), or Sports bookies (for example I’m
                    farming Azuro by betting on Bookmaker). During promotions of
                    these platforms, you can find profitable trades/bets. But
                    you have to keep a close eye on the promotion. For example,
                    an exchange can have a deposit bonus, deposit 10$ get 10$
                    for free. Collect all the bonuses on several exchanges and
                    your $10 might be $200 in no time. This is obviously no slam
                    dunk, but the road to riches is long my friend. A list of
                    exchange bonus options will be shared in our third chapter.

                  <h2>2] Set up Your Wallet Farm</h2>
                  <p>
                    Our second chapter is focused on setting up your wallet farm
                    which applies to beginners and experts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What do I mean by wallet farm? Well to optimize your time,
                    you should create several wallets on each chain you want to
                    farm. Think about Ethereum (EVMs), Solana, Injective, SEI,
                    Avalanche, or Bitcoin. Whichever chain you want there are
                    several wallet options
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why set up multiple? Joining an airdrop costs some time, the
                    majority of that is getting to know a project and going
                    through the steps the first time. Once you have learned how
                    to do this, why not do it again on a second wallet, a third,
                    a fourth, etc. This optimizes your time spent to farm one
                    project or potential airdrop.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One thing to keep in mind, the best thing is to have no
                    on-chain connections between your farming wallets. What do I
                    mean by that? Well, don’t fund them all from the same
                    wallet. Put the initial capital in the wallet from different
                    sources (CEX or otherwise) and avoid transactions between
                    them. Some projects filter out wallets that have previous
                    connections.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Keep a low balance on the wallets, even when you’re done
                    farming. We noticed the recently hyped Starknet Airdrop
                    required wallets to have a few GWEI balances or they were
                    eliminated from the free $STRK drop.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Wallet Airdrops</h2>
                  <p>
                    Some wallets have potential future retroactive airdrops
                    coming, or they have a point system that translates to a
                    future reward. We have a list of 7 wallets that are suitable
                    for airdrop farming and different chains. I recommend
                    checking it out.
                  </p>
                  <p>Wallet Tips:</p>
                  <ul className="wp-block-list">
                    <li>Keep main funds in a hardware wallet</li>

                    <li>Fund farming/burner wallets with minimum capital</li>

                    <li>Have no on-chain connection</li>

                    <li>Keep a low balance at all times</li>

                    If you have trading skills, there are plenty of airdrop
                    farming options for you out there which we discuss in this
                    chapter.

                  <p>
                    If you lack this skill set, it might be a good time to study
                    trading fundamentals to create a solid trading strategy.

                    You don’t need to become a master trader. If you accomplish
                    that you will be out on yacht parties in Dubai. No, we want
                    you to learn basic support/resistance trading so you can get
                    in “low risk, low reward” type trades. You are not aiming
                    for a 50% gain on your trade, you’re farming an airdrop.
                    Whether it’s based on trading volume or frequency.

                    can take months before distribution, make sure to keep your
                    wallets active from time to time so it looks like you’re an
                    actual human user, instead of a farmer who came in for a
                    couple of trades and left. Long-term activity will also help
                    your total volume to go up which can lead to a significant
                    reward.

                  <h2>4] Airdrop Farming by Being an Early User</h2>
                  <p>
                    This chapter is more dedicated to medium and experienced
                    farmers. It pays to be early. We’ve seen it countless times,
                    be an early user or beta tester and you receive a
                    retroactive reward down the line. Some old examples are
                    Uniswap, or the ENS airdrop. More recently, we saw Arbitrum
                    and Optimism. Farmers who dedicated time and some capital
                    here all reaped the benefits of it later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are a ton of Testnet Airdrops now that hint or rumor
                    future airdrops. It’s pretty simple, as a testnet user we
                    help test a platform. We risk our time and capital, and
                    projects usually show their appreciation for it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Usually, you want to test out all functionalities, which
                    requires a little crypto know-how. If this is your first
                    time in the ring, take your time and get used to it all.
                    Make sure to swap, bridge, use faucets, register domains,
                    add to liquidity pools, stake, unstake, vote, trade, and
                    every other thing you can think of doing on the chain, do
                    it!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Don’t forget to stay active over time and avoid on-chain
                    wallet connections (like mentioned in our wallet section).

                  <h2>Testnet Airdrops</h2>
                  <p>
                    Just this week we dedicated a blog to 7 different Testnet
                    Airdrops, which you can read here. There are several more
                    coming and active this year, so keep an eye on our DeFi
                    section to catch them all.

                <div className="Provider">
                  <h2>5] Liquidity Provider</h2>
                  <p>
                    This chapter is only for the chads who have capital and
                    liquidity available.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A solid option is liquidity pools. On a DEXs they allow
                    token trading without centralized order books. Smart
                    contracts manage trades, adjusting prices based on supply
                    and demand. Contributors earn rewards proportional to their
                    liquidity. New solutions require liquidity for traders to
                    use it. Hench you get a nice yield when you add liquidity.
                    The newer and smaller pools can offer 4-figure APR returns,
                    while bigger pools might offer you between 5-15% APR
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While you earn this yield, a lot of projects will reward
                    early liquidity providers with a retroactive airdrop. This
                    is applicable with test stages, but also on mainnets.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I’m personally providing liquidity to DojoSwap at the
                    moment, to earn some yield and farm their potential airdrop.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another flavor of proving liquidity is lending. You can do
                    this on cryptocurrencies or Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This
                    option provides a yield as well, as you earn interest on
                    your loans. While several platforms give you airdrop
                    opportunities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you don’t want the currency exposure, you can hedge your
                    position. Example: If you need ETH to provide liquidity, but
                    don’t want ETH exposure. Use Aave or a similar platform,
                    deposit stablecoin as collateral and borrow ETH. This way
                    you don’t have an actual ETH position. Similarly can be done
                    with altcoins by shorting them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can also reuse your capital when using lending
                    platforms. Example: You use stablecoin collateral to borrow
                    ETH, then you use that ETH to borrow stablecoins. This way
                    you are paying interest, but you are farming an airdrop.

                  <h2>Lending Airdrops</h2>
                  <p>
                    We listed 5 lending options for currencies, and 2 for NFTs
                    in our blog last week. I personally focus a lot on NFT
                    lending, not per se for airdrop farming but the yield is
                    attractive and the airdrops are a bonus.

                    Another chapter for farmers who have access to capital, and

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Staking is a well-known term in crypto, and is used to earn
                    a decent ROI. If you stake ETH you can earn 5% APR, which
                    should be your bare minimum if you’re considering locking
                    some funds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Restaking enables users to secure multiple networks
                    concurrently by staking identical tokens on the primary
                    blockchain and other protocols. Despite the heightened risk
                    of slashing, restakers enjoy augmented rewards for embracing
                    this extra risk. This method, introduced by Eigenlayer, has
                    grown immensely popular amongst airdrop farmers over the
                    past few months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similar to providing liquidity, you can hedge your
                    positions. In this scenario, you’re mostly locked for some
                    time. So make sure to take that risk of opportunity cost in
                    consideration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I’m personally farming Blast, Renzo (+ Eigenlayer), and some
                    Celestia and Cosmos-related airdrops through Keplr Wallet.

                  <h2>7] Deepdive into Ecosystems</h2>

                  <p>
                    This chapter is relevant for everyone, whether you are a
                    noob or a seasoned farmer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One way to optimize your time, capital, and risk is to dive
                    into an ecosystem. It’s much easier to track projects on one
                    chain than it is to be an expert on all chains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You also save time and cost sticking to 1 native currency.
                    For example, if I own a decent-sized bag of $SOL, I might as
                    well farm as many Solana ecosystem airdrops as I can. Or a
                    new kid on the block, Blast, releases new projects and
                    airdrops daily. We will have a blog with a list of that
                    soon, as by now we listed 10 Blast Layer 2 airdrops in the
                    past 10 weeks on AirdropAlert.com

                    Below is a short list of ecosystems you can study and take a
                    pick of one or two. For the ones with a hyperlink we created
                    a list and information on farming, the remaining are yet to
                    come. But plenty of options on those chains are already
                    listed on our site.

                  <h2>8] NFT Airdrops</h2>
                  <p>
                    This chapter is for all levels, but it requires capital.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last bull market, NFT holders got rewarded with plenty of
                    airdrops. If you minted a BAYC (by Yugalabs) for $200,
                    within a year you would have received 6 figure airdrops by
                    just holding it. Insane! NFT holders also enjoyed platform
                    airdrops, in the likes of Blur, Looksrare, and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is no guarantee that we see another airdrop frenzy for
                    NFT holders this year. However, some projects have been
                    airdropping their coins to holders of prominent collections.
                    Pudgy Penguins got $7k worth of Dymension, while Tensorians
                    (on Solana) got a similar amount. Azuki is rumoring their
                    own coin and Airdrop this year and there are a lot more
                    examples. Even the famous memecoin $BONK, airdropped
                    significant amounts to the larger Solana NFT collection
                    holders. More recently, ordinals have been receiving a ton
                    of airdrop love. Obviously, holding an NFT brings its own
                    set of risks. So only do this if you’re confident in this
                    market niche.

                    In addition, platforms are rewarding you for volume and
                    liquidity. Blur broke the internet by giving away hundreds
                    of millions of $BLUR with their 2 airdrops last year. If
                    you’re buying or trading NFTs, here are some NFT platforms
                    airdropping to NFT trading volume soon:

                    Some web3 games are token-gated, meaning you need to hold a
                    specific NFT to participate. But lots of these P2E games are
                    free to play, and you earn tokens while you do it. Either
                    based on time, tasks, or results.

                  <p>
                    Today, we see countless gaming options to earn airdrops. In
                    essence, you play a web3 game and earn a native token or
                    result-based price. I got to claim 7400 $PIXEL (sold at
                    $0.65) this week just for performing a few simple ingame
                    tasks and a couple of referrals. Last year, 1 gamer earned
                    an NFT for being the #1 spot of the game Dookey Dash (by{" "}

                    game again, this time it’s not token-gated. Rumors are that
                    Yugalabs will add <strong>1 Million Dollars</strong> to the

                    You should all skip this chapter, as we are shooting
                    ourselves in the foot here. But it needs to be said, to help
                    you maximize your income.

                  <p>
                    A ton of projects offer referral rewards, this applies to
                    all the categories in this blog. While it’s fairly easy to
                    share your referral link with a couple of friends. Most of
                    them won’t sign up
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then you might earn a little by signing up on your own
                    referral links under burner wallets and accounts, aka
                    sybilling. However, this will only earn you on the volume
                    you provide yourself.

                  <p>
                    How to scale referrals? Easy, become an influencer. We’re
                    not suggesting all of you become the next generation of
                    TikTok stars. But you can share your airdrop farming
                    knowledge on X, or start a small discord or Telegram group
                    and slowly grow this while you earn, and your
                    friends/followers earn as well.

                    Small warning note here, watch out for the tons of larps on
                    social media pretending to be airdrop experts but mainly
                    promoting the shit of the shit for payments.

                    With Airdrops, you can find ways to optimize. Sometimes
                    doing 1 task can qualify you for 2 or more airdrops. Other
                    times, u need to bridge to a certain chain, but you find
                    another exit route to spread airdrop qualifications.

                    Tobi is trying to minimize cost and time and cover 5
                    airdrops by doing a few tasks. In his tweet, he has a
                    step-by-step description.

                  <p>
                    We’re considering adding more airdrop route content in the
                    future. It’s very time-consuming, and we want to get it
                    right. So we are looking into it. For now, the best tip we
                    have is to search social media for airdrop routes if you’re
                    considering farming a project or ecosystem.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Tip: Sell Your Airdrop on the Pre-Market</h2>
                  <p>
                    While it’s always exciting to wait for an airdrop and pray
                    you hit the jackpot, there are ways to sell or hedge your
                    allocation. This can significantly reduce the risk. Often
                    new projects are quite fragile, and one bad tweet from a
                    founder can reduce confidence which results in a lower
                    price.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I use{" "}
                    <a href="https://app.aevo.xyz/r/Opaque-Screeching-Armstrong">
                      AVEO
                    </a>{" "}
                    every week, as they often offer pre-market and perps for
                    coins yet to be airdropped. You can short a position, to
                    hedge while you wait for airdrop distribution. Or you can
                    long it, if you’re confident in the project. I also expect
                    an airdrop for AEVO, so I’m farming that while I hedge other
                    airdrop positions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another option is{" "}

                      Whales.Market
                    </a>
                    . Not only do they offer pre-markets for coins, but you can
                    even sell airdrop points. As the point system is the new and
                    growing meta. It comes in handy to being able to dump your
                    points when you need liquidity. I’ve sold some of my Friend
                    Tech points at $1 per point. We still have no clue when
                    these points ever convert to an actual airdrop, so getting a
                    dollar per point seems reasonable.{" "}

                  <h2>Don’t Forget: Find Unclaimed Airdrops in Your Wallets</h2>
                  <p>
                    Last but not least. Have you ever checked your wallets to
                    find unclaimed airdrops?{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Usually, this is the case when you are a regular ETH or
                    Solana user, and a project decides to retroactively reward
                    you. However, you never heard of the project or airdrop, so
                    logically you missed the claim.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Luckily there are sites for that. Check{" "}

                    to find unclaimed airdrops. Who knows what you have missed
                    and is still claimable. Just don’t pay for airdrop
                    information that these types of sites might advertise. All
